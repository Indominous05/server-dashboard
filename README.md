# server-dashboard

A modern, real-time **server monitoring dashboard** built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” powered by simulated data.

This interactive tool visualizes **CPU**, **Memory**, **Disk**, and **Network** usage across multiple simulated servers, and dynamically highlights:
- High CPU alerts  
- Process failures  
- Recovery notifications  

Designed to look and behave like a lightweight control center, the dashboard uses **periodic data simulation** to mimic real-time server activity without requiring a backend or live API.
